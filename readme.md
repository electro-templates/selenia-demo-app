# demo-app

##### Demonstration Application for the Selene Framework

This simple application will be installed as a project module into your application's `private/modules` folder.
It will **not** be installed as a composer package, so it will become part of your application and it will be submitted to
Git with it.

## Installation

Type this on the terminal, on your application's directory:

```shell
selene module:install-template selene-framework/demo-app
```
