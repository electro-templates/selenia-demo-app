# demo-app

##### Demonstration Application for the Selenia Framework

This simple application will be installed as a project module into your application's `private/modules` folder.

It will **not** be installed as a composer package, so it will become part of your application and it will be submitted to
Git with it.

## Installation

To install this template on your application, using the terminal, `cd` to your app's directory and type:

```shell
selenia module:install-template
```

and select `selenia-templates/demo-app` from the displayed list, or type

```shell
selenia module:install-plugin selenia-templates/demo-app
```

> **Warning**: this package cannot be installed with Composer. You must use the `selenia` CLI.
